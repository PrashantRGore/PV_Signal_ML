## 🔍 What Would Be Needed for Production Validation

### GAMP5 Validation (FDA/EMA Standard)

To achieve formal FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance, this system would require:

1. **User Requirements Specification (URS)**
   - Formal documentation of all system requirements
   - Regulatory requirements mapping
   - Risk assessment

2. **Design Specification (DS)**
   - Detailed system architecture documentation
   - Security design review
   - Data flow diagrams

3. **Installation Qualification (IQ)**
   - Verification that system is installed correctly
   - Hardware/software compatibility testing
   - Environmental controls

4. **Operational Qualification (OQ)**
   - Verification that system operates as designed
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing

5. **Performance Qualification (PQ)**
   - Verification that system performs consistently
   - Long-term stability testing
   - Edge case testing

6. **System Administration**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Change control procedures
   - Disaster recovery plan

### Estimated Effort
- **Time:** 6-12 months
- **Cost:** $200,000 - $500,000+
- **Resources:** Regulatory affairs, QA, security, software engineering

## 🛡️ Security & Data Protection Status

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Immutable audit logs (JSONL format)
- ✅ Data lineage tracking
- ✅ GDPR deletion registry
- ✅ Pseudonymization support
- ❌ Encryption at rest: Not implemented (Plaintext local filesystem storage; research prototype only)

### NOT Implemented
- ❌ User authentication (no login system)
- ❌ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ❌ Encryption in transit (HTTPS not enforced)
- ❌ Intrusion detection
- ❌ Penetration testing
- ❌ Security audit trail separation
- ❌ Formal security policy

### Risks for Production Use
- **No user authentication:** Anyone with access to the server can modify data
- **No RBAC:** Cannot restrict access by role (e.g., analyst vs. reviewer)
- **No encryption in transit:** Data could be intercepted over network
- **No formal security controls:** Does not meet enterprise security standards
- **Public code:** System architecture is visible to potential attackers
